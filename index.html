            <blockquote id="bio">
                <p><b>Bhagat Singh </b> was born into a Punjabi Sikh family on 27 September 1907 in the village of Banga in the 
                    Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second 
                    of seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu.
                    Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the 
                    agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915</p>
